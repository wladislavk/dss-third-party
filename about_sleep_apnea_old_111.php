        <div id="faq1" class="icongroup1">

        <img src="images/image_1.gif" width="160" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" />Apnea literally means "cessation of breath".Obstructive Sleep Apnea is simply what the words state - obstructions that happen during sleep that cause a cessation of breath.  The human upper airway is encircled by muscles.  The largest of these muscles is the tongue.  When we are awake we have tonicity or tightness in these muscles of the upper airway but during sleep these muscles relax. <br />
        <br />
        As we breathe during sleep, these relaxed muscles may vibrate causing snoring and can eventually collapse into the airway causing a decrease of airflow into the lungs.  Usually, due to this suffocation, our brain eventually wakes up out of the deeper stages of sleep and tightens up the muscles of the upper airway to again allow the airflow to return to normal. This can unknowingly happen hundreds of times a night resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness, mental impairment, cardiovascular problems and a multitude of other undesirable side effects.        </div>
        <div class="eg-bar"><span id="faq2-title" class="iconspan"><img src="images/minus.gif" /></span>How can Dental Sleep Solutions dentists help?</div>
        <div id="faq2" class="icongroup1">
        As stated previously, snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome are both caused by a collapse of the upper airway when the muscles relax during sleep.<img src="images/image_4.gif" width="160" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" />  The largest muscle and most likely culprit for this problem is the tongue.The tongue muscle is much larger than most people may realize.  The tongue not only is present in the oral cavity; it also extends down the throat throughout most of the length of the collapsible upper airway. <br />
        <br />
        Dental Sleep Solutions dentists have obtained specialty training in custom making FDA approved adjustable dental sleep devices (DSD) that help control the collapsing of the tongue into the airway. A dental sleep device that resembles a sports mouth guard is comfortably worn in the mouth during sleep.  <br />
        <br />
        This device helps prevent the collapse of the tongue into the airway, thus decreasing snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea.Most people find these devices much more comfortable than CPAP (the other primary treatment for OSA and snoring) and far less invasive and more predictable than surgery.        </div>

        <p><img src="images/image_7.gif" width="160" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" />The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends dental sleep devices as a first line of treatment option for anyone who has mild to moderate apnea and for anyone (even severe apnics) who cannot tolerate CPAP.  The AASM states that these devices should be made by a dentist who has had specialty training in the field of sleep medicine.  This prohibits physicians from making the dental devices and they should not be made by dentists without the proper training.  Our Dental Sleep Solutions dentists will work closely with your physician to make sure that your dental sleep therapy is medically successful.</p>

        <div id="faq7" class="icongroup1">
        <p>Humans are the only primates known to have this condition.  Sleep disorder breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea have been around for many years.  But, diagnosis and treatment has been limited until recently.  It is speculated that as our faces have become more flat and as we developed changes to improve our speech we as humans have become prone to this serious disorder.  OSA can affect anyone, but certain craniofacial profiles (shape of jaw and head) can make some more susceptible.  Also an increase in weight will cause more unstable tissue in the upper airway which can lead to higher incidence of problems.  The incidence of OSA increases with age and loss of muscle tone, but it can affect a person of any age or weight.</p>

        <p><img src="images/animate_img5.gif" width="160" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" />For proper diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea or other forms of sleep disorder breathing, an overnight sleep test is necessary.  The test consists of placing leads to measure certain body functions such as breathing, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory effort, etc.  The tests vary in number of leads (which are called channels) and the method for obtaining the information.</p>

<p>Traditionally these tests have been accomplished by an attended study in a sleep facility rather than in the patient's home.  These attended studies are called  Polysomnographs (PSG) and have been used for many years for the diagnosis of sleep disorder breathing, OSA and other sleeping disorders.  Recently home testing has become approved by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for diagnosis of OSA.  There is much debate in the medical community about which type test is the most preferable and below we will detail each type and the advantages and disadvantages of each:</p>

        <p><img src="images/image_10.gif" width="160" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" />Most people readily adapt to wearing the dental sleep device. After wearing the device for a short period of time it will become part of your routine and most people will hate to go to sleep without it. Compliance rates for dental sleep therapy are much higher than for other forms of non surgical treatment.  By most studies show 80 to 95% of individuals will comfortably wear their devices nightly. Once the symptom relieve is noted from the dental sleep therapy it is rare for someone to discontinue use. One of the cofounders of Dental Sleep Solutions, Dr. Gy Yatros, wears an appliance nightly. He is quoted by saying &quot;I can't sleep properly without it and it is the first thing I pack when going on a trip&quot;.</p>

        <p><img src="images/image_11.gif" width="160" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" />Yes, it is encouraged for you to continue to see your existing dentist for routine and preventative dental care.  The goal of your Dental Sleep Solutions dentist is to treat your snoring or OSA.  Although it is necessary for your DSS dentist to evaluate your teeth, their goals and your normal dentist's goals are likely very different. Your DSS dentist is evaluating your teeth to insure that they are stable enough for dental sleep therapy and they are not performing routine preventative care.  Our Dental Sleep Solutions staff will insure that we work closely with your existing dentist and will forward them copies of any pertinent records or x-rays that were completed during your visit.</p>

        <div class="eg-bar"><span id="faq17-title" class="iconspan"><img src="images/minus.gif" /></span>Do I need a custom device and why can't I just order one off TV?</div>
        <div id="faq17" class="icongroup1">
        <p>There is much evidence that custom made adjustable dental sleep devices are far more effective and comfortable than self fitting, &quot;boil and bite&quot; devices. The self fitting devices are typically much more bulky which decreases their effectiveness as well as comfort.  Furthermore most of these self fitting devices are not adjustable.  Successful dental sleep therapy is extremely dependent on the adjustability of the dental sleep device.  Without this adjustability success rates drop dramatically.</p>
        <p>OSA is a serious and life threatening medical disorder.  It is unadvisable to treat it or any other serious medical problem without proper medical supervision and guidance.  Failure to adhere to this standard could have serious medical risks.  To learn more about the process of dental sleep therapy see &quot;The Dental Sleep Solutions Experience&quot;.</p>

        <div class="eg-bar"><span id="faq18-title" class="iconspan"><img src="images/minus.gif" /></span>How long will the Dental Sleep Devices last?</div>
        <div id="faq18" class="icongroup1">
        <p><img src="images/image_12.gif" width="160" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" lowsrc="5" />Longevity of dental sleep devices are very case dependent.  It varies depending on the specific device made, forces placed on the device and your care of the device.  Each individual Dental Sleep Solutions office have their own policies but typically any problems with the device during the first year is covered by your initial fee.  If after the first year a dental sleep device needs repair or to be reconstructed, the fee is normally less than the initial fee (which included the exam and adjustment of the device) (<a href="#" class="page">See Dental Sleep Solutions Experience for details</a>).</p>
<p>Most medical insurances will pay for construction of a new dental sleep device every two years and their longevity can be from one to many years in length.</p>

        <div class="eg-bar"><span id="faq19-title" class="iconspan"><img src="images/minus.gif" /></span>Can you make an appliance just for snoring alone?</div>
        <div id="faq19" class="icongroup1">
        <p><img src="images/image_13.gif" width="160" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" lowsrc="5" />Yes, dental sleep devices work quite well at diminishing snoring. However, if you are a snorer and have never had a sleep test it is advisable to be screened or tested for the more serious disorder of OSA.- Rich fill in percent of snorers have OSA and often without them knowing it. See our section on &quot;Free Sleep Screening&quot; for more information.</p>

        <p>If a diagnosis of made of Primary Snoring (no OSA) then a dental sleep device can be made to control the snoring.  Typically the procedures needed to accomplish this goal are far less than that of someone with OSA.  Since there is no need for home sleep testing and physician consultations the resulting fee is usually lower.</p>

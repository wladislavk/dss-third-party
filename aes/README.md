This repository consists of two older classes written by Strategy Star Inc. in 2011 that were not previously under git,
yet still used for encryption purposes by some companies. They were tested for PHP 5.6 or higher, and they require mcrypt
extension to be manually installed for PHP 7.2 or higher. No licensing information is available, and Strategy Star does
not exist anymore, so I took the liberty to use the MIT license.

http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex1/ddlevelsmenu/\n// ** Usage Terms: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/notice.htm\n\n// ** July 7th, 08'- Creation Date\n\n// ** July 16th, 08'- Updated to v 1.3:\n// 1) Adds \"Side Bar\" orientation option.\n// 2) Drop Down Menus now auto adjust their positioning if too close to either right or bottom window edges.\n// 3) Enhanced IFRAME shim \"coverage\" on the page.\n\n// ** July 19th, 08'- Updated to v 1.31: Drop down menu now positions at top of window edge if there's neither room downwards or upwards to settle.\n// ** Aug 13th, 08'- v1.32: Moved \"rel\" attribute from menu's <li> elements to inner <a>, for validation reasons\n\n// ** Sept 10th, 08'- Updated to v 1.4:\n// 1) Added optional \"sliding\" animation when sub menus are revealed.\n// 2) Arrow images now dynamically positioned, instead of relying on CSS's \"right\" property\n\n// ** Oct 11th, 08'- Updated to v 1.5:\n// 1) Sliding animation behavior tweaked\n// 2) Added ability to disable iframeshim, customize speed of sliding animation\n\n// ** Dec 23rd, 08'- Updated to v 2.0:\n// 1) Animation speed refined to be function of time (ie: 1 sec)\n// 2) Added two animations that can be individually enabled/disabled- \"slide in\" and \"fade in\".\n// 3) Script now automatically moves HTML for all sub menus to the end of the page, to avoid any containership issues if they are nested in other elements.\n\n// ** Jan 12, 09'- Updated to v 2.1:\n// 1) Added ability to disable the arrow images from the top level items (see option \"showarrow\")\n// 2) For Top Level Menu items containing a SPAN element (for sliding doors technique), arrow images are inserted inside SPAN.\n\nlet ddlevelsmenu = {\n  enableshim: true, // enable IFRAME shim to prevent drop down menus from being

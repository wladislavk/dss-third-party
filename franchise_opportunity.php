    <p>The opportunities that exist in dental sleep medicine are astounding.  While other dentists are talking about decreased revenues, due mostly to the economic woes of society, Dental Sleep Solutions&reg; is helping dentists increase their revenues as well as their quality of life.  Through our proven systems and support, Dental Sleep Solutions &reg; facilitate dentists in developing a new profit center for their practice.  Our guidance helps these offices to provide a highly needed service for their community while giving dentists an enjoyable hiatus from the physical and mental challenges of a typical dental practice.</p>   

<p>Talk about being in the right place at the right time! Research estimates that up to 9% of adult males and 4% of females suffer from sleep disordered breathing, yet fewer than 10% have been diagnosed.  In fact, the most recent studies have shown that 1 in 4 adults in the United States (31% of all men and 21% of all women over 18) are at "high risk" for OSA (based on analysis of the National Sleep Foundation's 2005 Sleep in America survey). It is estimate that the American public spends over 3 billion annually on the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea!</p> 

<p>Yes the numbers are staggering and most of these dollars are spent on CPAP. Because of the low CPAP compliance rates nearly half of these patients need an alterative treatment. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, a dental sleep device is the alternative treatment of choice for patients who can't tolerate CPAP. The opportunity to provide a therapeutic alternative to CPAP, to help our patients sleep better, breathe better, feel better, is right in front of us. It is doubtful if dentistry will ever see an opportunity like this again in the future!  Now is the time to get involved!</p>

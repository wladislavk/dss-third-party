The term &quot;You&quot; or &quot;you&quot; means the individual or entity who is using the Service under this Agreement. BY CLICKING &quot;CREATE ACCOUNT&quot; OR THROUGH THE CONTINUED USE OF THE SYSTEM, YOU ARE UNDERTAKING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONFERRING LEGAL RIGHTS.

<p><br />
 This Software as a Service Agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) is a legal agreement between you and Dental Sleep Solutions Franchising LLC, a Florida limited liability company (&quot;Provider&quot;), governing your use of the Dental Sleep Solutions Practice Manager software (the Software&quot;) as a hosted solution via Provider's web site (www.dentalsleepsolutions.com) (the &quot;Service&quot;). The term &quot;You&quot; or &quot;you&quot; means the individual or entity who is using the Service under this Agreement. The term &quot;use&quot; means accessing, displaying, executing, loading or otherwise using the Service.</p>
<p><br />
 <strong>Service License</strong>. You are granted a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable, limited license to use the Service for your internal business purposes in accordance with this Agreement during the Term.</p>
<p><br />
 <strong>Scope of License</strong>. This Agreement grants you up to ten (10) user accounts that will allow you to use the Service. Fees paid under this agreement are non-refundable, except as provided in this Agreement or when required by law. One (1) account, defined as the &ldquo;Provider of Record&rdquo; will have administrative permissions, which will provide the user the ability to make global changes, such as password management and ledger/financial correction. One (1) &ldquo;Provider of Record&rdquo; account is permitted per license (where &ldquo;Provider of Record&rdquo; is an account utilizing an individual NPI or other differentiating insurance identifiers for the purpose of allowing a person to document and/or bill patient procedures). Up to nine (9) other accounts will have general use (non-administrative, non-&ldquo;Provider of Record&rdquo;) permissions. Each member of your authorized workforce who accesses Provider&rsquo;s services must have a unique identifier. You will ensure that under no circumstances credentials for one member will be used or assigned to another member. Additional &quot;Provider of Record&quot; or non-administrative accounts are subject to additional fees, as determined by Provider.<br />
 The &ldquo;Provider of Record&rdquo; is a party to this Agreement for all purposes. Although a member of a &ldquo;Provider of Record&rsquo;s&rdquo; authorized workforce may have created the initial account or electronically entered into this Agreement, or may continue to administer administrative duties on the &ldquo;Provider of Record&rsquo;s&rdquo; behalf, only the &ldquo;Provider of Record&rdquo; is entitled to any of the rights, remedies or benefits under this Agreement and control over the administrative rights of the account. The &ldquo;Provider of Record&rdquo; is likewise subject to all of the covenants, restrictions, limitations, representations, warranties, waivers and releases included in this Agreement. The &ldquo;Provider of Record&rdquo; may delegate administrative rights and duties to one or more members of the &ldquo;Provider of Record&rsquo;s&rdquo; authorized workforce, but the &ldquo;Provider of Record&rdquo; remains responsible for all activity occurring thereunder.</p>
<p><br />
 <strong>Equipment</strong>. You are responsible for and must provide all equipment, software (other than any software provided by Provider) and services necessary to use the Service. The Software may currently be accessed by any modern browser. However, at some point in the future, Provider may elect to provide you with a custom browser to be installed on your computer in order to access the Software (the &quot;Custom Browser&quot;), for purposes of enhancing Software security. You agree to promptly install any such Custom Browser on behalf of all users hereunder.</p>
<p><br />
 <strong>Privacy</strong>. Provider will not sell, exchange, or release any confidential patient information you upload to the Service to a third party without your express permission, unless required by law or court or governmental order; provided that Provider may disclose such information to a third party to the extent necessary to perform Provider&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement (as defined below) (e.g. sending patient information to an insurer in connection with an insurance claim). Provider may contact you regarding account status and other matters relevant to the underlying Service and/or any use your confidential information, including without limitation your patient treatment data statistics, for purposes of making suggestions and recommendations to you in connection with your performance. Both you and Provider agree to adhere to data security standards of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&quot;HIPAA&quot;).</p>

Provider offers no assurance that your use of the Services under the terms of this Agreement will not violate any law or regulation applicable to you. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Provider will keep Your information private and will not share it with third parties, unless we believe in good faith that disclosure of Your information is necessary to (i) comply with a court order, warrant or other legal process, (ii) protect the rights, property or safety of Provider or others, (iii) investigate or enforce suspected breaches of this Agreement, or (iv) allow our third-party partners to comply with their obligations under federal or state law.</p>

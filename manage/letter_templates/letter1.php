Dear %salutation% %contact_lastname%:
</p>
<p>
Thank you for allowing us a few moments of your time.  We represent Dental Sleep Solutions Franchising, LLC, a franchise entity that recruits, trains, and provides administrative support to dentists in the area of dental sleep medicine.
</p>
<p>
Our dentists receive training from Board Certified dentists in the areas of:<br /><ul>
<li>Sleep medicine and sleep disorders</li>
<li>Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB)</li>
<li>Treatment options for SDB</li>
<ul>
<li>Including CPAP, dental device therapy, surgery, and behavioral solutions</li>
<li>Unique hybrid therapies that include mating CPAP to a dental device</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We are writing to you today to invite you to partner with us in diagnosing and treating patients with sleep disordered breathing.  We promote a team healthcare approach that involves the physician and dentist working closely to provide a successful treatment modality for each and every patient.  If you feel that your patients could benefit from a sleep screening consultation, we invite you to contact us directly so that we can put you in touch with a local Dental Sleep Solutions&reg; provider.  Rest assured that when you are dealing with a Dental Sleep Solutions&reg; dentist, you are dealing with an individual who understands the issues and the treatment options. 
</p>
<p>
Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.
We look forward to a long and prosperous relationship and thank you for your referrals in advance.
</p>
<p>
Regards,
<br />

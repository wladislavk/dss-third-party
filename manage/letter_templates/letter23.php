<p>Dear %contact_firstname%:</p>

<p>Itâ€™s hard to believe that it was nearly three years ago that we delivered your dental device.  I hope that you are wearing your device and continuing to reap the benefits of better sleep and better health.  I am writing to you today because most dental devices begin to show significant wear around the three year mark and can lose their ability to effectively treat your sleep disordered breathing.   Most insurers will pay to have them remade if necessary, so we'd like to encourage you to set up an appointment so that we can evaluate your device for possible replacement.</p>

<p>Please give us a call here at the office to schedule an appointment.  We look forward to seeing you soon!</p>

<p>Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
<br />
%franchisee_fullname%</p>";

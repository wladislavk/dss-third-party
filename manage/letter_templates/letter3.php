<p>Dear %contact_firstname%:</p>

<p>Are you tired at times when you don't want to be?  Do you find it difficult to get out of bed in the morning?  Do you feel fatigued and irritable?  Is your bed partner complaining more and more about your snoring?</p>

<p>You may be suffering from Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).  Repeated closure of the upper airway during sleep leads to many unwanted outcomes including the following:
<ul>
  <li>loud snoring</li>
  <li>stopped breathing episodes</li>
  <li>poor, unrefreshing sleep</li>
  <li>excessive daytime sleepiness</li>
  <li>impotence</li>
  <li>weight gain</li>
  <li>increased risks for hypertension and heart attack</li>
  <li>diabetes</li>
  <li>congestive heart failure</li>
  <li>stroke</li>
  <li>increased risk for falling asleep while driving.</li>
</ul>

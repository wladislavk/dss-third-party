Intro
=====

This repository presents a short tutorial on how to write acceptance tests.
It is divided into two parts, the first part called Features is intended for project
managers and lead developers, the second one called Contexts is for all developers.

To launch provided example tests, ensure that you have PHP 7.1 (at least in CLI mode),
PHP-SQLite extension, Composer and SQLite 3.x installed, then run `composer update`, 
then `./run.sh`.

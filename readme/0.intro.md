Intro
=====

This repository presents a short tutorial on how to write acceptance tests.
It is divided into two parts, the first part called Features is intended for project
managers and lead developers, the second one called Contexts is for all developers.

To launch provided tests, ensure that you have PHP 7.1 (at least in CLI mode) and Composer 
installed, and ports 8643 and 9222 are not occupied, then run `composer update`, then 
`./phantom.sh` for PhantomJS and `./chrome.sh` for non-Selenium version of Chrome 
headless (quicker but more volatile than PhantomJS).

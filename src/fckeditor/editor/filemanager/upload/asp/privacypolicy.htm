        Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because 
        we gather certain types of information about the users of Mall Of India.com's 
        network of sites and services, we feel you should fully understand the 
        terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. 
        This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use 
        it, and how to correct or change it. </font>

          Information Mall Of India.com Gathers and Tracks</A></B></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>
          Mall Of India.com gathers two types of information about users: data 
          that users provide through optional, voluntary registrations on several 
          of our sites and in certain contests and sweepstakes; and data Mall 
          Of India.com gathers through aggregating tracking information derived 
          mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites and click through 
          on our newsletters. Such information enables us to better tailor our 
          content to viewers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand 
          the demographics of our audience. The only situation in which Mall Of 
          India.com divulges information about an individual user to a third party 
          is with certain contests and sweepstakes--and then, <I>only with the 
          user's express consent.</I> </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mall Of 
          India.com gathers user information in the following processes: </font>
        <P><font color="#333333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>• 
          Optional Registration</B></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>
          Several Mall Of India.com sites offer free, voluntary registration to 
          users: Mall Of India.com, News.com, and Gamecenter.com. By registering, 
          users can enter the sites without having to log on each time; they gain 
          access to the polling area; and they can take advantage of personalization 
          (the ability to select content according to a user-supplied profile). 
          </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 
          registration the user <FONT color=#333333><B>is required</B></FONT> 
          to supply a username, password, and email address, and must answer mandatory 
          survey questions about age, gender, income, Internet connection, zip 
          code, country, employment status, and other employment information. 
          </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 
          registration the user <FONT color=#333333><B>has the option</B></FONT> 
          of supplying a first name, last name, and password hint. In addition, 
          the user can opt to subscribe to various Mall Of India.com electronic 
          newsletters and to have his or her email address and/or URL appear in 
          postings. </font>
        <P><font color="#333333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>• 
          Polling</B></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>
          Several Mall Of India.com sites offer interactive polls to users so 
          they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what the 
          Mall Of India.com audience thinks about important issues. Mall Of India.com 
          uses a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote 
          only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with 
          information about individual users. </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While aggregate 
          counts of click through behavior are provided to advertisers, an advertiser 
          will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. Mall Of India.com 
          does not target advertising against specific user information. Mall 
          Of India.com will not provide specific user information to any third 
          party company. </font>
        <P><font color="#333333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>• 
          Surveys</B></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>
          Occasionally Mall Of India.com conducts user surveys to better target 
          our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic 
          information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never 
          share any of this information about specific individuals with any third 
          party. </font>
        <P><font color="#333333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><A name=contests>• 
          Contests and Sweepstakes</A></B></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>
          Mall Of India.com offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request 
          certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information 
          includes name and email address; in some cases, the user must answer 
          mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal data. The 
          information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's 
          identity, to send the entrant an email notification that their entry 
          has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. There 
          are two situations in which Mall Of India.com will divulge this information 
          to a third party--<I>provided the user gives express consent:</I> </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. A user 
          may expressly choose to receive additional information from the contest 
          sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable information 
          is divulged to the advertiser. </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Some 
          of the contests may be hosted on the Mall Of India.com site but administered 
          by the sponsor; in such cases, the information a user provides is passed 
          on to the third party <I>as long as that user gives express consent.</I> 
          </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because 
          the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about 
          each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes 
          are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state 
          laws. </font>

          sites. </font>

# 2.1.5. Collection styling

Collections, such as arrays and objects, SHOULD be defined in idempotent manner,
so that any two lines can be swapped without affecting the code.

Multi-line arrays SHOULD be defined with one element per line and a comma after
each element, including the last element.

Models and structs that have setters returning `$this` SHOULD be defined in the
following manner:
```
$object
    ->setOne($one)
    ->setTwo($two)
;
```

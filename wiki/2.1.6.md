# 2.1.6. String literals

String literals are dangerous because there are no IDE hints for them and they are
easy to mistype. String literals SHOULD be transferred to class constants or even to 
system-wide config. There SHOULD NOT be more than 10 string literals per class outside
of tests. If a string literal is reused in several classes, it SHOULD be decoupled into
a constant of its own class or a model/struct if it relates to a value of a model/struct
property.

See 3.5.1 on how to reduce number of string literals by getting rid of
unneeded arrays.

# 2.1.7. Indentation

The code SHOULD NOT have more than one level of block-based indentation and MUST NOT
have more than two levels of block-based indentation. Block-based indentation is defined
as indentation arising from conditionals or cycles, it does not include classes,
functions, lambdas and 'beautifying' indentation due to breakup of long strings.

If indentation is bigger than that, methods need to be extracted.

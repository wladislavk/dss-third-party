# 2.1.8. Working with IDEs

If working with an IDE, a coder SHOULD ensure that the code gives as few warnings
and notices as possible and that no warnings or notices are suppressed in IDE settings.

The following texts is actual for newer versions of PHPStorm, but should be applicable
to most modern IDEs.

The code SHOULD NOT give any IDE warnings whatsoever. The code MAY give IDE notices
for reasons of having duplicate classes in same namespace (it's a special allowance to
overcome Laravel magic methods) but SHOULD NOT give any other IDE notices. The code
SHOULD give IDE hints for every method called, no matter on what object.

In order to ensure that these rules are respected, phpdoc comments MUST be present,
according to 2.1.2. Also, a need MAY arise to use third-party plugins, such as IDE helper
for Laravel.

# 2.2.1. Beware of facades

Laravel facades is a framework feature introduced for rapid prototyping. Unfortunately,
though it is technically possible to mock a facade in Mockery, doing that is a bit of a
hassle. Worse than that, facades conceal class's dependencies, making it harder to see
how the class actually works.
 
For this reason, facades MUST NOT be used inside unit-testable classes, such as services
and models. Facades should be swapped for constructor dependency injections.

# 2.2.2. Beware of static model calls

Static calls on models work basically in the same way as facades (see 2.2.1) and are
equally dangerous. Static model calls MUST NOT be present in unit-testable classes.
Inside services, static model calls MUST be swapped for constructor dependencies,
while inside models, `$this` should be used.

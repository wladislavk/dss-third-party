# 2.2.3. Handling of SRP violations in Eloquent

Eloquent models, being based on Active Record pattern, share its well-known flaw
of violating the Single Responsibility Principle. Namely, a model class does two different
things:
 
1) it instantiates an active record object and sets its properties, then saves it
to the DB,
2) it defines some methods that can be used for executing SQL queries on a number
of such objects.

These are fundamentally different, because 1) SHOULD be initialized via `new` keyword and
SHOULD NOT be mocked in a unit test while 2) SHOULD be initialized as a constructor dependency 
and SHOULD be mocked.

To cope with this difference, a naming convention SHOULD be followed, namely,
an instance of type 1 SHOULD be named the same as its model class, as in
```
$foo = new Foo();
```
while an instance of type 2 SHOULD be suffixed with `Model`, as in
```
$this->fooModel->find($id);
```

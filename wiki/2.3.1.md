# 2.3.1. setUp() method

A class under test SHOULD be initialized only once per unit test in its `setUp()`
method and saved into a test class property. If the class under test has any constructor 
dependencies that need to be mocked, all calls to mocking methods SHOULD be done 
immediately before class initialization in `setUp()` method. If there is any other code 
in `setUp()`, it SHOULD come before class initialization, as in
```
private $foo;

public function setUp()
{
$this->someProperty = 1;
$mock = $this->mock();
$this->foo = new Foo($mock);
}
```

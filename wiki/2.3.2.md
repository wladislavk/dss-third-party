# 2.3.2. Separation of mocks

All mocking methods, no matter which framework they use, SHOULD be decoupled from
the main test code into separate methods and/or classes. If mock-related methods are contained 
in the same class as tests, they SHOULD be located below `setUp()`, `tearDown()` and `testX()`
methods.

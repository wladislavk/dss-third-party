# 2.3.3. Using callbacks for mocked methods

In PHPUnit, there are some concerns about timing when using mocks. In order to overcome
these concerns, and also to increase code readability, callbacks SHOULD be used
for mocked methods whenever there is a shadow of doubt over the possibility of changing
expected return value or arguments at runtime. For example, this code
```
$mock->shouldReceive('foo')->andReturn($this->returnValue);
```
SHOULD need to be rewritten as follows:
```
$mock->shouldReceive('foo')->andReturnUsing([$this, 'fooCallback']);
...
public function fooCallback()
{
    return $this->returnValue;
}
```

The mock callback methods SHOULD either be anonymous or follow the naming convention 
with the word `Callback` at the end of method's name.

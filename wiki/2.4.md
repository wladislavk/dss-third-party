# 2.4. Naming conventions

Class, method or variable names MUST NOT be abbreviated or shortened unless the meaning
is perfectly clear. How to determine is the meaning perfectly clear or not? If you can
say the abbreviation out loud and you will be understood, then it's perfectly clear.
For example, if you pronounce USA as in 'yoo-es-ey', you will be understood, so it's not
necessary to write 'United States Of America'. In software development, examples
of perfectly clear abbreviations and shortenings are 'DB' for database and 'repo'
for repository.

However, names SHOULD be terse and SHOULD NOT be more than 30 characters long. An
exception is made for test classes and methods because they are never called directly.

`Abstract` prefix MUST be used for abstract classes.

`Interface` suffix MUST be used for interfaces.

`Trait` suffix MUST be used for traits.

`Exception` suffix MUST be used for exception classes.

Class names SHOULD be nouns or noun phrases, while method names SHOULD be verbs or verb phrases.

If there is a choice whether to use singular or plural word for class, singular
SHOULD be used, with the exception of words that are used mostly in plural, such as 'data'.

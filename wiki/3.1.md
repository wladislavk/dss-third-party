# 3.1.1. Controllers

As it is well known, controllers SHOULD be skinny, which means 'as short as possible'.
A controller SHOULD NOT have logic, such as conditionals or cycles. However, sometimes
it is needed to return early, such as when an exception is caught. In these cases,
controller MAY have a simple conditional, such as
```
try {
    $myService->doSomething();
} catch (MyException $e) {
    $message = 'error!';
    return ApiResponse::error($mesage);
}
```

This is the only kind of logic that MAY be present in a controller. All other conditionals
and cycles MUST be decoupled into service classes.

Controllers MUST NOT contain neither class properties nor methods that are not called
by routing mechanism.

Since controllers are not unit-testable, they MAY contain calls to facades, however
it is advisable to use dependency injection whenever possible.

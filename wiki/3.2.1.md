# 3.2.1. Separation of repository code from models

As noted in 2.2.3, Eloquent models tend to violate SRP, making them harder to test
and mock. Therefore, the model code SHOULD be divided into actual active record data,
which is inseparable from base `Model` class and should not be mocked, and repository
classes that contain calls to Eloquent methods.

Model classes SHOULD contain only active record properties, special properties such
as table name, and getters and setters, if needed.

Repository classes SHOULD contain all eloquent calls. Repository classes MAY contain
static calls to `DB` facade and static model calls.

Both repository classes and model classes SHOULD NOT be unit-tested, however model
classes SHOULD NOT be mocked and MUST be initialized using `new`, while repository 
classes SHOULD be mocked and MUST be initialized using constructor dependencies.

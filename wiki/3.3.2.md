# 3.3.2. Service hierarchies

According to OOP principles, hierarchies SHOULD be used to prevent code duplication and
provide cleaner and easy-to-test code. A hierarchy SHOULD be created when:
1) there is some code duplication in a service;
2) there are similarly-named methods calling a single method from the same service or another service.

Every hierarchy MUST have either an abstract class or an interface at its top.
If there is even a single line of common code between hierarchy members, including
common constructor dependencies, an abstract class SHOULD be used.

All hierarchy members, including abstract classes and interfaces, MUST reside under
a common namespace that is dedicated exclusively to the members of this hierarchy.

Hierarchies SHOULD NOT be created 'just in case', i.e. if a coder 'feels' that different
implementations might appear in the future, even if there is just one implementation
in the present, it should be refactored into a hierarchy as soon as the second implementation
appears, but not earlier.

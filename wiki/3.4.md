# 3.4. Factories

A factory is a class that returns objects of other classes. This document deals with
OOP factories, that are not to be confused with Laravel factories that populate Eloquent
models.

A factory SHOULD be created in one of two cases:
1) a case of polymorphism where an abstract method of a certain hierarchy needs to be called
and the implementation is chosen based on some condition;
2) all implementations of a particular hierarchy need to be used in a sequence.

There MAY be other cases for factories as well.

Factories MUST reside in a namespace of their own. Factories SHOULD NOT be unit-tested.
Certain operators such as `switch`, `elseif` and `instanceof` MAY be used in factories but
SHOULD NOT be used in other non-template code.

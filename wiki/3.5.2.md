# 3.5.2. Defining structs

Struct is a keyword in C that creates a kind of class that has only public properties
and no methods. Structs are used as keepers of structured data that are easier and safer
to handle than arrays, they are important in SOA where it is not allowed to keep any
data on service classes themselves. An Eloquent model is a glorified struct because
its primary function is also to keep data, however in many cases it is much easier to
create your own struct instead of using Eloquent.

Structs MUST be located in their own namespaces. Structs SHOULD NOT be tested since
there is nothing to test. Structs SHOULD NOT be injected as constructor dependencies,
all instances of a struct SHOULD be created via `new` keyword. Therefore, structs
SHOULD NOT be mocked in a unit test.
 
Every field of a struct MUST have its own phpdoc and MUST be type-safe, not counting
nulls. If a field of a struct is an array, it MUST be initialized with a default array 
value (usually an empty array) and SHOULD have all elements of the same type.

There MAY exist a hierarchy of structs should a need arise.

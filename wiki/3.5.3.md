# 3.5.3. Getters and setters

Sometimes, a common operation needs to be performed on an element before it is added
to a struct or a model. Also, using methods rather than public properties gives a little
more convenient syntax to the caller and methods can better ensure type-safety. Therefore, getters 
and setters MAY be added to a model or a struct. The following rules apply.

Once a field contains a getter, it MUST contain a setter, and vice versa. Once a field
contains a getter and a setter, it MUST be declared private or protected.

All setters MUST return `$this`. It allows chaining of setters, as in `$foo->setA($a)->setB($b);`
All setters for non-scalar fields MUST contain appropriate type hints.

Structs are not unit-testable, therefore getters and setters SHOULD NOT contain
conditionals with the exception of type-safety checks that SHOULD throw an exception.

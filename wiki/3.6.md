# 3.6. Static classes

PHP, unlike Java, does not have a concept of static classes, however, if a class
has at least one static method, all other methods MUST be static in order to evade
confusion.

Generally, static classes SHOULD NOT be created, but there are some notable exceptions
when a static class creates more terse syntax for very common operations.

In Laravel, static classes SHOULD be registered as facades for better integration with
the framework and handling dependencies. However, even if registered, a static class
SHOULD NOT contain any logic and MUST reside in a dedicated namespace. Static classes
cannot be properly unit-tested, so they SHOULD have some kind of helper non-static class
that would be unit-testable and would contain all of the class's logic.

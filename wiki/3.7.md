# 3.7. Third-party code

There are a lot of issues that may arise from improper handling of third-party code.
Also, it may be a huge waste of time to test that code and some legal issues as well.
 
Therefore, all third-party code MUST be decoupled from the application code. The easiest
way to decouple that code is by using Composer. If the code is Composer-compliant,
it should be included through `composer require`. Otherwise, the code MUST be made
Composer-compliant by making a fork of the original repo and then adding it to Packagist.
All further maintenance of this code is transferred to the coder who created the fork.

However, as a general rule, the third-party code that was not unit-tested by its creator,
SHOULD NOT be used in the project. Rather than that, it SHOULD be reverse-engineered
in accordance with the project guidelines.

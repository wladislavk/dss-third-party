# 3.8 Exceptions

All errors MUST be handled using PHP exception mechanism.

Custom code MUST NOT throw pre-defined exceptions by PHP or Laravel. Rather than
that, all custom code SHOULD throw either `GeneralException` or its derivatives.
Sometimes the code MAY throw a custom exception that would extend a more specialized
PHP or Laravel exception. Every module that throws exceptions SHOULD define its own exception.
If a custom non-controller code expects an exception thrown by PHP or Laravel and
then wants to re-throw it, it still MUST use a custom exception, not the one that was caught.

The majority of exception-handling code SHOULD lie in the controller or in a special
service created just for that purpose and called by the controller. The exception-handling
code SHOULD differentiate between exceptions called by PHP or Laravel and exceptions
called by custom code.

All exceptions that are mentioned in `@throws` annotations MUST be caught somewhere 
in the code, presumably in a controller or a middleware, except for `RuntimeException` and 
its derivatives, that MUST NOT be caught and are intended to display 500 error to the client. 
If a coder wants to throw an uncatchable-by-design exception, they MUST do it by creating a 
custom subclass for `RuntimeException`.

All exception class names MUST be suffixed with the word `Exception`.

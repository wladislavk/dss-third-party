# 3.9. Miscellaneous

The code MUST NOT be copy-pasted, ever. Use decoupling, extension or polymorphism.

Liskov Substitution Principle MUST be honored. If a method is overridden by a child class,
it MUST have a similar signature to its parent method. If a constructor is overridden,
it MUST call the parent constructor. Most IDEs will give warnings if LSP is violated.

If it takes more than a couple of hours to write unit tests for a class, refactoring
SHOULD be done.

All methods MUST be private by default. All properties on a class that is neither
a model nor a struct MUST be private or protected. If a class is abstract, its methods and properties
still MUST be private, not protected, unless they are actually used by children.

Unused code MUST be deleted. If a coder is sure that the code will be used in the nearest
future but has to commit while the code is not used, they SHOULD place a TODO comment
above the code. In the same vein, public methods without public calls MUST be made
private and hierarchies with a single implementation SHOULD be flattened.

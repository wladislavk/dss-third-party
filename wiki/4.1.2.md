# 4.1.2. Mockable and non-mockable classes

A unit test MUST mock its mockable dependencies and SHOULD NOT mock its non-mockable
dependencies. A mockable dependency is any class that cannot be perceived as a simple
collection of elements. Therefore, structs and collections SHOULD NOT be mocked.
An Eloquent model, as described in 2.2.3, may contain both mockable and non-mockable
properties and methods. As a general rule, properties, getters and setters of a model
are non-mockable, while everything else is. A partial mock is usually not necessary for 
a model because of how models get passed to their dependents.

See 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 for specifics on mocking.

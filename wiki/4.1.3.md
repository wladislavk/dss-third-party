# 4.1.3. Test wrappers

PHP standard lib includes some non-class functions that try to connect with an
external resource, like `is_file()`. Also, some third-party libraries include static calls to 
external APIs that cannot be called dynamically. While it is technically possible to mock such
function, it feels like a hack. Therefore, test wrappers SHOULD be used in such cases.

A test wrapper is a class that exists solely as a decorator for calling non-class functions
or static methods. A test wrapper SHOULD NOT contain any logic. A test wrapper
SHOULD be injected via a constructor. An example of test wrapper:
```
class FileWrapper
{
    public function isFile($filename)
    {
        return is_file($filename);
    }
}
```

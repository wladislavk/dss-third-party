# 4.1.4 Test cases

Sometimes, especially when testing hierarchies, a need arises to reuse some mocks
and test initialization code between several test classes. In these cases, separate
abstract test case classes SHOULD be created that would extend from a base test case, depending
on what suite is used. Then, actual test classes SHOULD extend the new test case.

Test cases MUST contain only class constants, properties, `setUp()` and `tearDown()`
methods, and mock methods. They MUST NOT contain any actual `testX()` methods.
If there is a need to run a `testX()` method on an abstract class code, then this method
SHOULD be run inside the least complicated descendant of the test case.

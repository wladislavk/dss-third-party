# 4.2.2. Working with the DB and cleaning up

Test database structure and data MUST be created using Laravel migrations and seeds
mechanisms. All API tests MUST be idempotent which means that both classes and
test methods inside a class can be swapped places without any effect on the tests.

To ensure idempotency, each test class that changes the database MUST have `tearDown()`
method that would restore the database to exactly the same state as after it was
seeded. This cleaning code MUST be located in `tearDown()` rather than `setUp()`,
`testX()` or class destructor.

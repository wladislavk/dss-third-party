# 6.1. General information

This section aims to achieve the following goals:
- modernizing and normalizing the DB
- improving data consistency across tables
- optimizing queries for both performance and readability
- improving testability of the application in general.

The rules laid out in this section should be understood as follows:
- MUST rules must be applied to all new migrations and queries, and should be applied
to old tables and queries whenever possible
- SHOULD rules need to be applied to both new and old tables and queries unless it
is unsafe (e. g. potential problems with legacy code) or unless it is proven that
observing the rule will lead to performance loss.

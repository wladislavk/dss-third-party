# 7.1.1 Basic JS styling

## Sources of truth

Unlike PHP, Javascript lacks definitive styling guides, and many of the existing guides
are incomplete. If this wiki does not state otherwise, the following sources SHOULD
be used for styling:
- [Standard JS style guide](https://standardjs.com/rules.html)
- [Documentation for Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide)
- Default presets for Webstorm IDE with ES6 syntax turned on (no errors or warnings should
be thrown by IDE)

## Newer EcmaScript features

Some newer features are unexplained or ambiguous in the mentioned sources. The following
rules SHOULD be observed to provide code uniformity:

EcmaScript classes MAY be used in services or other standalone files. Classes SHOULD NOT
be used in files that are parts of default structure of Vue.js, Vuex or Jasmine,
until the official documentation for this products will include class-based examples.

"Const by default" variable declaration syntax SHOULD be used in accordance with Vue.js
documentation.

ES6-style imports SHOULD be preferred over `require()`.

Other features, such as argument destructuring and arrow syntax, MAY be used whenever
their usage leads to more concise code.

# 7.1.2 Constants and symbols

## Constants

`const` keyword SHOULD be used for declaration of any immutable variable. However,
a distinction should be made between "real" constants, that can never change after
the declaration, and "pseudo" constants, that can be changed if the value change does
not require re-assigning.

"Real" constants SHOULD use upper-snakecase, and SHOULD reside in separate files,
while "pseudo" constants SHOULD be camel-cased.

## Symbols

Symbols are references to string literals that are used to refer to Vuex actions,
getters and mutations. Symbols SHOULD reside in a separate file. String literals
that are symbols' values SHOULD use upper-snakecase, while symbol names themselves
SHOULD be camel-cased. Symbols and referenced strings SHOULD be identical, except
for case, in order to prevent accidental referring of two symbols to the same string.

All references to Vuex objects, except for direct references to state properties,
MUST use symbols rather than string literals.

In order to evade namespacing problems, symbol groups (getters, actions, mutations)
MUST be flat objects.

# 7.1.3. Length limitations

Javascript in general is more concise than PHP, therefore JS files outside tests 
SHOULD NOT be longer than 150 lines long and MUST NOT be longer than 200 lines long. This 
rule does not apply to Vue templates.

Methods SHOULD NOT be longer than 25 lines and MUST NOT be longer than 40 lines.

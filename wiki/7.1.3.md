# 7.1.3. Length limitations

JS files outside tests 
SHOULD NOT be longer than 200 lines long and MUST NOT be longer than 300 lines long. This 
rule does not apply to Vue templates, however templates SHOULD NOT be longer than 200
lines, as long files usually mean that components should be extracted.

Methods SHOULD NOT be longer than 30 lines and MUST NOT be longer than 60 lines.

# 7.1.4 Unwanted operators and expressions

`else` and `else if` SHOULD NOT be used outside of templates for the same reason as 
explained in PHP styling guide.

`switch` SHOULD NOT be used except in factories and factory-like functions that return
immediately. `default` operator SHOULD NOT be used at all.

Ternary operator SHOULD NOT be used outside of templates.

`while` SHOULD NOT be used, use `for` instead.

`for` SHOULD be used mostly as a part of `for...of` operator. `for...in` operator
SHOULD NOT be used, especially with external input such as API responses, because it makes
implicit assumptions about what properties exist on the object. In the case where a
coder is absolutely sure of input safety, `hasOwnProperty` check MUST be used inside
`for...in` operator.

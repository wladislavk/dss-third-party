# 7.1.4 Unwanted operators and expressions

"Else" and "else if" SHOULD NOT be used outside of templates for the same reason as 
explained in PHP styling guide.

"Switch" SHOULD NOT be used except in factories and factory-like functions that return
immediately. "Default" operator SHOULD NOT be used at all.

Ternary operator SHOULD NOT be used outside of templates.

"While" SHOULD NOT be used, use "for" instead.

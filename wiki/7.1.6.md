# 7.1.6. Directory structure and file naming conventions

Components MAY be located either in the same folder as their parent or in subfolders. 
JS part of a component MUST reside in its own file, names of `.vue` and `.js` files for 
the same component MUST be identical.

Directory names MUST be lower-cased, while file names SHOULD use pascal case if they
have a default export of an object or a class, and SHOULD be lower-cased otherwise.

CSS files MUST have the same name as the name of their component, however, CSS filenames
SHOULD use hyphen-case instead of pascal-case. CSS files MUST be located at the same path
relative to `assets/css` as the path of their component relative to `src/components`.

Test files MUST be suffixed with `.spec.js` and SHOULD be located at the same path under
the directory of their test suite as the path of their corresponding SUT file under 
`src/components`, `src/services` or `src/store` directory.

Vuex objects MUST be wrapped in modules. One file MUST NOT contain more than one module,
but bigger modules SHOULD be divided into several files.

Component names, when used in tags, MUST include at least one hyphen to keep up with 
W3C spec.

# 7.1.6. Directory structure and file naming conventions

Component paths MUST correspond to the component directory tree, in other words, child
components MUST be located in subfolders relative to their parents. JS part of a component
MUST reside in its own file, names of .vue and .js files for the same component MUST
be identical.

Directory names MUST be lower-cased, while file names SHOULD use pascal case if they
have a default export of an object or a class, and SHOULD be lower-cased otherwise.

Test files MUST be suffixed with ".spec.js" and SHOULD be located at the same path under
"tests" directory as their corresponding SUT file under "src" directory.

Vuex objects MUST be wrapped in modules, with the rule being "one module = one file".

Component names, when used in tags, MUST include hyphen to keep up with W3C spec.

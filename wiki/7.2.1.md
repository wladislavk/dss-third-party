# 7.2.1. Components

In general, components in Vue are roughly analogous to controllers in Laravel, so the same
guidelines apply. Components SHOULD be slim and SHOULD be devoid of logic.

Simple data MAY be kept on component, however for any heavier operations state SHOULD
be used. Computed properties, unless trivial, SHOULD be no more than callers for Vuex
getters.

Components MUST be usable and testable in isolation from other components. Components 
MUST NOT call other components directly by such means as `this.$parent`. Components
SHOULD NOT issue Ajax calls directly, use actions instead.

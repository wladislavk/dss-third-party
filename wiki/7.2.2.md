# 7.2.2. Mixins

Mixins are a suggested way of adding reusable code in Vue docs. However, mixins are
quite like PHP traits, they may be confusing to read and debug. Vuex largely makes mixins
obsolete by providing more concise API for reusable actions. Mixins SHOULD NOT be
used in the project, use services and Vuex actions instead.

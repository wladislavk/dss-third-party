# 7.2.2. Mixins and watchers

Mixins are a suggested way of adding reusable code in Vue docs. However, mixins are
quite like PHP traits, they may be confusing to read and debug. Vuex largely makes 
mixins obsolete by providing more concise API for reusable actions. Mixins SHOULD NOT 
be used in the project, use services and Vuex actions instead.

Watchers are used when for some reason DOM cannot be watched using standard means such
as props and computed properties. Watchers SHOULD NOT be used unless they are absolutely
unavoidable.

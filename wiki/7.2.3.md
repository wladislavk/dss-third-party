# 7.2.3. Services

Vue does not provide any way to manage services, however, services are a more convenient
and handy way to provide pieces of reusable stateless logic.

A service is a plain Javascript collection, that can be either a class or an object
literal. Services may interact with the outside world and may contain logic, however,
they MUST NOT be stateful and MUST NOT include any watchable properties such as calls
to Vuex, components or plain DOM manipulation.

Services MAY depend on other services, but one needs to be careful with dependencies
as Vue does not provide a container, and large dependency chains will become hard to
manage. Services SHOULD NOT contain more than two dependencies, and the dependent
services SHOULD NOT depend on any other service.

# 7.2.4. Templates

`.vue` templates MUST be used. Plain `script` tags SHOULD NOT be used in templates for
anything else than linking to the template's JS file.

Templates SHOULD NOT contain more than one `style` tag and all styles SHOULD be scoped.

Templates SHOULD NOT contain any logic other than simple equality checks.

Templates SHOULD NOT contain non-trivial cycles, that contain a lot of markup inside
`v-for`. In a case where such cycles are needed, it is better to extract a component
and place `v-for` on a component tag.

Whenever a method is called directly from a template, parentheses SHOULD be used in
order to differentiate between a method and a computed property, since the latter
MUST be called without parentheses.

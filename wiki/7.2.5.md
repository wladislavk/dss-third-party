# 7.2.5. Vuex modules

A Vuex module consists of properties, getters, mutations and actions. Getters and
actions MAY be called from components, while mutations MAY be called from components and actions,
and actions MAY call other actions. Properties MAY be retrieved from a component,
but getters SHOULD be used when a plain call to a property will result in the need of a logic-ful
computed property.

Modules other than root MUST NOT include other modules and MUST NOT use namespacing.

Strict mode is not enabled for Vuex for performance reasons, but it still MUST be
honored, in other words, state MUST NOT be changed from anywhere but mutations.
Strict mode MAY be violated in a test for better readability.

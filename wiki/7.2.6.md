# 7.2.6. Promises

Arrow function syntax MUST be used for promises for easier access to the main function
context.

Promises SHOULD be resolved only in Vuex actions (not in components or services)
to prevent confusion.

Promises MUST NOT be nested inside the same entity, use `dispatch()` to call other
actions that might resolve more promises.

# 7.2.6. Promises

Arrow function syntax MUST be used for promises for easier access to the main function
context.

`catch` MUST be used instead of second argument to `then`.

Promises SHOULD be resolved only in Vuex actions (not in components or services)
to prevent confusion. A promise MAY be resolved in a component when no AJAX call is done,
if it leads to more concise code.

Promises MUST NOT be nested inside the same entity, use `dispatch()` to call other
actions that might resolve more promises.

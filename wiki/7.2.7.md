# 7.2.7. Third-party packages

Third-party packages MUST NOT be used unless a version of the package exists on npm.
If a non-npm third-party package is encountered when migrating legacy code, its functionality 
SHOULD be emulated using a newer npm package, preferably written for Vue, or, if no
such package is present, new code SHOULD be written.

jQuery plugins MUST NOT be used, as it's extremely hard to test all their functionality
with all native Vue watchers.

As it happens, many third-party packages are not sufficiently tested; it is recommended to
test the third-party functionality that is actually used by our app in browser tests.

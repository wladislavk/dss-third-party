# 7.3.1. What should be tested

The application includes two levels of tests: unit tests and browser (aka functional)
tests. Unit tests mock all their dependencies, while browser tests mock only those
dependencies that lead outside of application, such as Ajax requests, cookies or
local storage.

Karma and Jasmine are used for testing, which means that, strictly speaking, all tests
are run in browser environment, however unit tests MUST be written so that it is
possible to run them without Karma.

Services and Vuex entities (getters, mutations and actions) MUST be covered by
unit tests, while components MUST be covered by browser tests. If there is any 
non-trivial logic in a JS component file, it SHOULD also be covered by unit test.

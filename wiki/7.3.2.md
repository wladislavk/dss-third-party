# 7.3.2. Writing unit tests

Unit tests SHOULD test all lines of code, so same rules for test coverage apply as for
PHP unit tests. Unit-testable files MUST NOT have hard non-mockable dependencies
such as calls to `process` object. If such a dependency is unavoidable, it MUST be
decoupled into a non-testable wrapper service, which MUST NOT be placed in the same
directory as testable services.

Sinon library SHOULD be used for mocking dependencies.

All Jasmine calls inside a test suite MUST NOT use arrow function syntax
to make it possible to use instance variables that were set in `beforeEach`.

If one test file has tests for several separate entities, such as Vuex entities,
test suites MAY be nested.

`done()` method MUST be used when testing promises, forgetting to add it might
lead to false positives.

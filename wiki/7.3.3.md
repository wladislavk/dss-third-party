# 7.3.3. Writing browser tests

Browser tests SHOULD test all instances of "moustache syntax" in templates, as well
as `v-if`, `v-for` and `v-bind:class`.

Browser tests SHOULD test all events.

Moxios SHOULD be used for mocking Ajax requests in browser tests.

It is not necessary to test interactions between components, this can be done in
acceptance tests.

# 7.3.3. Writing browser tests

Browser tests SHOULD test all instances of "moustache syntax" in templates, as well
as "v-if" and "v-for".

Moxios SHOULD be used for mocking Ajax requests in browser tests.

It is not necessary to test interactions between components, this can be done in
acceptance tests.

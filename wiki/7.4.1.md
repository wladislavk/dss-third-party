# 7.4.1. HTML style guide

In general, HTML SHOULD conform to the W3C specification for HTML5.

Indentation in HTML MUST be 4 spaces, except for elements of Javascript interpolation, e.g. inside script tags
and non-trivial Vue bindings, where indentation is set at 2 spaces.

Double quotes MUST be used for attributes.

Style attributes MUST NOT be used, use CSS classes instead.

In case of long lines, a tag MAY be split into several lines, one attribute per line.

Non-paired tags SHOULD end on `/>`.

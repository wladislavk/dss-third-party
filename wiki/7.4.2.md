# 7.4.2. Vue-specific HTML

Refs MUST NOT be used unless absolutely necessary.

`v-if` and `v-show` SHOULD NOT have any non-trivial logic (meaning - other than check for true / false 
value). Otherwise, the logic SHOULD be put into computed properties.

`v-if` SHOULD be used, when the condition is unlikely to change during the component's lifetime;
otherwise, use `v-show`.

Shorthands for bindings and events SHOULD NOT be used.

Both methods and computed properties are defined as Javascript functions. To differentiate between them,
braces SHOULD be used when calling a method from HTML, while braces SHOULD NOT be used when referring to
a computed property.

# 7.4.3. CSS and SASS

If any custom CSS is used on a component, the component MUST refer to one and only one scoped stylesheet.
All stylesheets MUST use SASS. Stylesheet tree MUST duplicate the component tree. 

There is one exception to the scoping rule: if a third-party component is being used, and styles for elements of
this component need to be changed, the component that imports the third-party component MAY refer to a non-scoped
stylesheet for the third-party component.

Every directory on the stylesheet tree MUST have a partial stylesheet, its name being `_{directory_name}.scss`.
If the partial is not in the root directory, it MUST import another partial that is located in its parent
directory. All stylesheets in a directory MUST import the partial of that directory. Partials contain styles
that are common for more than one component in the directory, including components in child directories.

IDs SHOULD NOT be used in styles. Use classes instead.

Stylesheets themselves SHOULD be flat, unless necessary. Selectors such as `hover` SHOULD be located
inside the parent style, while elements or classes MAY be both inside and outside of parent style scope.

`display` and `visibility` properties SHOULD be governed by Vue directives and SHOULD NOT appear
in CSS, except for using non-standard display types, e.g. `display: block` for a link.

# 8.2.1. Branch and commit naming

The strategy for smaller branches MUST correspond to "one issue - one branch" rule. Branch naming MUST use 
this format: *{branch-number}-{branch-description}*

Any developer MAY create a branch but only if a Jira issue was created beforehand. If there is already a
branch for this issue, a new branch MUST NOT be created - create a sub-task or a new task for same epic
instead. However, one issue number MAY be used for several branches, if they are in different repos - see
Multi-repository branches.

If the scope of the original issue was reviewed and it was decided to limit or expand it, it is up to
developer to rename the branch or not. However, if there is some discrepancy between the branch name and
the contents of a PR, the creator SHOULD provide an explanation in PR description.

If the issue is a part of an epic, the corresponding branch MUST be branched off either the root branch of 
the epic or any other branch belonging to the same epic.

If the issue is marked as a subtask, the corresponding branch MUST be branched off the main branch of the
task. Otherwise, all branches are branched off master.

Commits SHOULD be named in the following format: *{branch-number} * Commit message*. Add a git hook to your
git settings to not forget adding branch number to every commit.

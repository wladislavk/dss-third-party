# 8.2.2. Multi-repository branches

Some issues span more than one repository. If this is the case, several branches with the same name MUST
be created, one per repository. There are the following rules associated with multi-repository branches:

1) PR's MUST be created simultaneously for all namesake branches.
2) The creator SHOULD notify reviewers and mergers in the PR description of the fact that other PR's for the 
same issue exist in other repos.
3) Reviewers SHOULD review all namesake branches within as short timespan as possible.
4) When merging, all namesake branches MUST be merged simultaneously, no matter if merging to master or
to an epic branch.

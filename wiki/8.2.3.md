# 8.2.3. Pull requests

A pull request MUST be created before the actual merging happens. The pull request SHOULD be created once the
creator considers the code is ready to merge, but it MAY be created prior to that if feedback is needed from
the team.

Merging MUST NOT happen before a pull request is present.

When a developer decides to create a PR, they MUST ensure that:
* the parent branch from which the branch in question was branched off originally, was pulled and merged 
  into the branch in question immediately before the PR is made, and any merge conflicts were fixed
* good enough test coverage is provided
* all needed tests, including acceptance, were run, and they all pass.

Pull requests MUST conform to the following rules:
* compare to parent task branch if the issue is a sub-task
* compare to the root branch if the issue is a part of an epic
* compare to master otherwise.

Note that if the branch is a part of an epic and it was branched off a non-root branch of the same epic,
it still needs to be compared to the root branch of the epic, not to its parent branch. However, the PR
creator MUST NOT let the child PR be created before the parent. Simultaneous creation of PR's for parent
and child is allowed, if the parent is mentioned in child's description.

The PR creator SHOULD provide a PR description containing the following information:
* any differences between the PR content and the branch / issue name
* the parent branch, if it is a non-root branch of an epic (to prevent merging the child before the parent)
* changes to gitignore'd files such as new configuration parameters
* changes to workflow such as new commands to run tests
* other repositories that contain PR's for the same issue number.

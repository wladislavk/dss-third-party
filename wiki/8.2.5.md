# 8.2.5. Merging

Once a PR has been approved by all reviewers and there are no other team members who are willing to conduct
a review, the PR SHOULD be merged without further delay.

Not every coder has the right to merge to a repo, if a coder cannot merge, they SHOULD ask someone who is
around and can merge. Even if the PR creator can merge, they SHOULD refrain from merging their own PR's
if there is someone else with the merging rights around, except for bugfixes. The reason for that is that while 
the merging process is on, the developer who merges may re-check portions of the code, familiarizing themselves 
with it and maybe even noticing a bug or guideline violation.

It is up to the coder who does the merge to fix any possible merge conflicts as they see fit. After the
merge is complete, the coder who does the merge MUST make sure that all automated tests pass.

If the issue has multi-repository branches, all these branches MUST be merged simultaneously.

After the merge, both the merged branch and the underlying issue MUST be closed to prevent accidental editing.
Any corrections added after the merge should be made in separate branches.

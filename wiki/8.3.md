# 8.3. Monorepo guide

Monolithic repository technique is used to provide easier branching and merging structure for the project while at
the same time being able to deploy different parts of the project on different servers. 

Our monorepo consists of two parts - deployable and non-deployable. On other branches than master the monorepo
is used like a usual git repository. When a new push to master is made (either for a regular merge at the end
of sprint or when a bug is fixed), all deployable parts of the monorepo (meaning all the code except for
the monorepo root and this wiki) get split into subtrees and pushed to their respective remote repos.

In order to split the monorepo, run `./split-repos.sh directory_name` from the monorepo root. Only first-level
directories are allowed to be split. In an exceptional case of splitting a non-master branch, branch name
can be added as a second argument.

All code changes MUST be done inside the monorepo only, subtree repos are read-only and other branches
except master in subtree repos exist for historical reasons.

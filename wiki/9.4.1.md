# 9.4.1. General rules

Behat context classes SHOULD be written in general accordance with the principles laid out 
in PSR-12 and in PHP style guide of this wiki regarding tests.

PHPUnit assertions MUST be used in all contexts.

All contexts MUST extend `BaseContext` class.

Context classes MUST NOT have a custom constructor and SHOULD NOT keep anything on their 
properties, except for properties that define global hook behavior.

It is recommended to define one context class per feature file, though in some situations 
more than one context class MAY be created for a single feature file.

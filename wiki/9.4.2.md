# 9.4.2. Given, When and Then methods

Certain rules regarding writing methods in context classes depend on whether a method is hooked to `Given`,
`When` or `Then` Gherkin annotation.

Though technically possible in Behat, a single method MUST NOT be used for more than one Gherkin annotation
type in different lines of feature files, i.e. if a method is annotated by `@Then`, it MUST NOT be activated
by `When` line in Gherkin.

## Naming convention

The following naming convention SHOULD be observed:
- `given` prefix for methods hooked to `Given`
- `test` prefix for methods hooked to `Then`
- no prefix for methods hooked to `When`.

## Assertions and exceptions

`assertX()` methods MUST be used at least once in `Given` and `Then` methods and MUST NOT be used in `When`
methods. 

Hardcoded assertions such as 
```
Assert::assertTrue(true);
```
MAY be used under certain circumstances.

`BehatException` and its descendants MAY be thrown in a `When` method if some prerequisite for an action 
is not observed, but MUST NOT be thrown in `Given` and `Then` methods - use assertions instead.

## Actions

Actions such as filling forms, firing mouse events etc. MUST be used at least once in `When` methods and
MUST NOT be used in `Given` and `Then` methods.

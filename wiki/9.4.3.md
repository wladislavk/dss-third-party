# 9.4.3. Lifestyle hooks

Methods corresponding to lifestyle hooks such as `BeforeStep`, `AfterScenario` etc. SHOULD be named in accordance
to the hook itself, such as `afterScenario()`. Custom names MAY be used if there is more than one method using
the same hook in the same class.

Unlike PHPUnit, Behat does not separate contexts inside the same suite, which means that all hooks in all
context classes of the suite are fired sequentially for every scenario or step of the suite. This makes it
impossible to do certain things such as set wait time before every step of a certain scenario without decoupling
this scenario into a separate suite. Some changes however need to be done for separate scenarios only,
such as restoring the DB state if it was changed during the test. In such cases, a boolean property SHOULD
be created on a certain context, set to true if a change was enacted, and referred to in the lifestyle
hook.

The order of execution of lifestyle hooks MUST be regarded as arbitrary and MUST NOT be relied upon.

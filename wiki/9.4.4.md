# 9.4.4. Main context and base context

All context classes are descended from `BaseContext` class that serves to specify common behavior and add
helper methods. However, one of its descendants is a special class called `Main` that is not handled in
the same way as other descendants.

Behat contexts are isolated and there is no native way to communicate between them. This can present a problem 
if a scenario is stateful and different lines of Gherkin are executed by different context classes. Whenever the 
client needs to be called, it MUST NOT be called from the current context class, but from the reference to `Main`
context. This way, it can be ensured that all HTTP calls are executed by the same client instance.

`Main` context also serves as a storage for common assertions and actions that are difficult to link 
to the specific context. On the contrary, `BaseContext` MUST NOT contain any `Given`, `When` or `Then` 
methods, it only handles global session and defines common helpers.

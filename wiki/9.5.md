# 9.5. Running tests

It is technically possible to run acceptance tests both from inside and outside of the Docker container. However,
restoration of DB state requires to run a special script that is allowed to run only from within the container
for security reasons. Therefore, acceptance tests MUST be run from within the container only.

Currently, all acceptance tests are written for Selenium2 and Chrome. The working executable
is `chrome2.sh`.

The first argument for both executables corresponds to the third-level domain inside the common Docker domain
that is set in Docker config. For example, if the common Docker domain is called `docker.localhost`, and
the container for Vue.js uses sub-domain `vue.docker.localhost`, then the first argument for executables
should be set to `vue` to run tests on that container. All other arguments are translated into Behat CLI
arguments, however `-f progress` is hardcoded and will always get appended to Behat CLI call.

# 9.6. Handling volatility

Acceptance tests tend to be volatile because of different reasons such as internet connection,
server response time and many others. By volatility, it is meant that the same test can either
pass or fail at random. Here are ways to cope with high volatility:
- check that `AfterScenario` hooks execute properly
- use `$this->page->wait()` to set wait time after page load or asynchronous action to make sure all JS 
  is loaded and all promises are resolved
- check that security measures for preventing brute-force attacks are disabled while in
  testing mode

However, it is impossible to completely defeat volatility, so the following rule is set:
every test SHOULD be run at least twice; if some attempts fail, further attempts are made, up to five. If 
the test passes at least two times, it should be considered "green". If there are less than two passes on 
five attempts, the volatility is too high to ignore and it might point to a real problem. If a coder is quite
sure that the volatility will not affect user experience and at the same time cannot be coped with, they
MAY leave it be, if a comment describing exact place of volatility and its possible reasons is provided.
